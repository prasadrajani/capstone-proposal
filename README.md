Install
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Dataset contain 1599 rows and 12 columns.Target variable is quality of wine whether it is bad or good.
Dataset has been extracted from Kaggle.

Features:
•	fixed acidity – It is non-volatile acid in the wine
•	volatile acidity – It is amount of acetic acid in the wine
•	citric acid – It is the amount of citric acid in the wine
•	residual sugar – It is the amount of sugar remained after the fermentation process
•	chlorides – It is the salt content in wine
•	free sulfur dioxide – It is amount of free sulfur dioxide present in wine as gas form
•	total sulfur dioxide – It is the amount of free and bound forms of sulfur dioxide
•	density – It is the density of water that is close to that  of water depending on the percent of alcohol and sugar content
•	pH – It is the value for representing how much it is acidic or basic nature
•	sulphates – It is the amount of sulphates in wine
•	alcohol – It is the percent of alcohol content in wine
Target variable:
quality-quality of the wine
